            A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.
           </li>
           <li>
            Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). 
           </li>
           <li>
            Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo.
           </li>
           <li>
            Camels do not directly store water in their humps; they are reservoirs of fatty tissue.

            Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015
           </li>
           <li>
            These species come in a range of colors, and many species have the ability to change color.
           </li>
           <li>
            Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail.
           </li>
           <li>
            Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.
           </li>
           <li>
            Chameleons are adapted for climbing and visual hunting
